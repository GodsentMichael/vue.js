# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

- Watchers: These are the secret observers of your property, they can perfom significant operations when certain conditions you state take effect. They are like functions you are simply using to make your code do something when the state changes/while something else is happening.

- Slots: Slots allows you to inject content into a component from the parent component where it's used.

- Teleport components: A case where we can use the other id outside of the app ID on which our app is mounted. We can also communicate with both #app and #other IDs inside the index.html(e.g when you're making a dynamic footer).You can also make use of reusable components or just use teleport components
